Your explanation should be structured and easy to follow, assisting the user in understanding the problem thoroughly. Remember, your goal is to guide the user through the problem-solving process with clarity and precision.

Change the nouns (if any present) and evaluate the correct answer for a given question. You will be provided with a {{problem_text}}, {{option_1}}, {{option_2}}, {{option_3}}, {{option_4}}, and the {{answer}}.

Instructions:

1. You are required to rephrase the following question, ensuring that the rephrased versions maintain clarity and intent while being equivalent in terms of the skills and concepts being tested.Each rephrased question should reflect the same level of difficulty as the original and should be easily understandable.
2. If the question contains any equations, provide them in the original form without changing them to English sentences.Don't keep options in the problem text. Put the rephrased question where "Problem Text Here" is written.
3. Your task is to solve the given problem by thoroughly understanding the problem, identifying relevant variables, formulating the necessary equation or formula, substituting the given values, simplifying and solving the problem, and then checking the units and context. Please provide step-by-step explanations for solving aptitude problems, including equations, in a clear and user-friendly manner.
4. When using LaTeX format in the question and explanation, please ensure that powers are correctly represented. Additionally, the generated JSON should be structured in a way that is easy to parse.
5. The exlanation should have atmost 12 lines,if it is more than it comprise it to 12 lines.
6. Your explanations should be easy to understand and follow, ensuring that the user can grasp the solution process easily. Please aim to break down the problem-solving steps into simple and comprehensible instructions, allowing for a smooth understanding of the concepts involvedEnsure to maintain line breaks for a clear explanation .
7. From now on, when answering questions, you should focus solely on the easiest way to solve the problem. Make sure to provide clear, detailed, and step-by-step instructions following this approach. If there are multiple ways to solve the problem, prioritize the shortest one and provide a comprehensive explanation. Remember, simplicity is key.
8. Make sure to keep the explanation brief and concise. Your responses should be to the point and avoid unnecessary elaboration. Remember, the goal is to provide short ,clear explanations without unnecessary length and place the solved explanation in the "Explanation" field.
9. Keep the solved answer in the "analyzed answer" field.
10. Compare the analyzed answer and the correct answer option; if they are the same, put True in "Matchness," otherwise put False.
11. Provide the generated problem in a JSON format as demonstrated below.

JSON Format:

```json
[
  {
    "problem_text": "Problem Text Here",
    "option-1": "option-1 Here",
    "option-2": "option-2 Here",
    "option-3": "option-3 Here",
    "option-4": "option-4 Here",
    "correct answer": "answerHere",
    "Explanation": "explanation here",
    "analyzed answer": "analyzed answer here",
    "Matchness": "Matchness here"
  }
]
```

Example JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "problem_text": "The population of the village is 8000. If 6% of men and 10% of women are added, the population becomes 8600, then the number of men in the village was:",
    "option-1": "4800",
    "option-2": "5000",
    "option-3": "5060",
    "option-4": "6000",
    "correcr answer": "option-2",
    "Explanation": "If the number of men in the Village is x, then that of the women will be (8000 - x)\nIf 6% of men and 10% of women are added, the population becomes 8600\nThis means that the additional number is 8600 - 8000 = 600\nTherefore 6% of number of men plus 10% number of women in the village is 600\n= 6% x + 10%(800-x) = 600\n= 6/100 x + 10/100(8000 - x) = 600\n= 0.06x + 0.1(8000- x) = 600\n= 0.06x + 800 - 0.1x = 600\n= 0.06x - 0.1x = 600 - 800\n= -0.04x = - 200\nx = - 200/-0.04\nx = 20000/4\nx = 5000\nTherefore the number of men in that village was 5000",
    "analyzed answer": "5000",
    "Matchness": "True"
  }
]
```
